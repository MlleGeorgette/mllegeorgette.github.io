Bonjour, wah gwaan, `print(“Hello, world!”)`. I’m Georgette Graham, and I’ve created this space to share my thoughts on life and work.

I began my career in corporate commercial law in Kingston, Jamaica, before swapping my bib for algorithms. Now, I am a data scientist in financial regulation. While this isn’t the final destination on my career journey, I thoroughly enjoy exploring emerging technologies and their impact on both the financial and legal industries. 

My journey hasn’t been all smooth sailing. I’ve funded my studies with scholarships, worked while going to school, and even made the bold decision to fly halfway across the world to switch careers. These experiences have helped shape my resilient personality and fuel my passion for continuous learning.

When I’m not working, I’m living life according to my own definition of happiness. I am a sports enthusiast, an avid traveller, and a fan of Christopher Nolan films. I also obsess over spreadsheets – whether it’s for planning a trip or tracking personal finance, there’s always a reason for a good Excel formula.

Thanks for reading.
