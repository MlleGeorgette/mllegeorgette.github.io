1.	<b>Preheat your life</b> with a curious mind. Watch the guys in the high school computer lab play Halo and wonder if you’d fit in, even though video games aren’t your thing.
2.	<b>Mix in 6 years of law studies</b> with the belief that there’s no turning back from a decision made at 19. If you’ve financed your studies through scholarships, you feel the expectation to become a renowned lawyer – perhaps even “Queen’s Counsel”.
3.	<b>Sprinkle in moments of excitement</b>, like taking a course in ‘Law, Money, and Technology’ and launching a tech blog during lockdown. 
4.	<b>Pour in anxiety</b> as you deliberate whether you see yourself practising law in 15 years. Add a dash of reflection on your initial interest in computer science.
5.	<b>Gently mix in the support of a friend</b> who shares an opportunity to pursue a data science career in the UK. Blend with encouragement from family and friends, kneading it into a dough of possibility.
6.	<b>Allow the dough to rise</b> as you prepare a baking sheet of ideas, assessing your immediate responsibilities vs long-term goals.
7.	<b>Grease the tin</b> with scholarships and bursaries. If this isn’t enough, borrow a couple of thousand from your supportive boss. Lightly dust with a touch of cold feet cornmeal. 
8.	<b>Shape the dough</b> into a loaf of nervousness and uncertainty about success.
9.	<b>Score the dough</b> with a sharp knife of courage, reminding yourself: “If not now, then when?”
10.	<b>Bake for a year</b>, doing a conversion course in Applied AI and Data Science. Remove from the oven when you’ve secured a job in a nurturing environment that welcomes the diverse flavours you bring.
