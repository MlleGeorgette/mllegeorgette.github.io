<div class="notice">
  <p>Who are you without loving us</p>
  <p>All of us with skin like yours</p>
  <p>Stripped down, painful and penniless</p>
  <p>Our intellect lies behind our eyes and we fight</p>
  <p>For moments like this –</p>
  <p>House us with no more biases</p>
  <p>Yes, you learned and wept and earned</p>
  <p>Showcased a strong sense of fight</p>
  <p>Mentally and financially, we’re chained to why</p>
  <p>They won’t let us just be</p>
  <p>And I admired a longing for unity</p>
  <p>A move to embrace and avenge history</p>
  <p>Until you refused to look into your own eyes</p>
  <p>Blinded by pennies or whatever the prize</p>
