<div class="notice">
  <p>I don't see stars anymore</p>
  <p>Dry eyes and firm, I enter the dark</p>
  <p>And I'm feeling, tripping, breathing</p>
  <p>For something that sparks a chain</p>
  <p>Reacting to it all, I spread</p>
  <p>This and that and hopes on sheets</p>
  <p>So strong yet hurt, she wanted better</p>
  <p>Flashing back to a dark time, double streaks</p>
  <p>Bled red she jumped to life and breathed</p>
  <p>I see them now –</p>
  <p>So many stars she wanted to see</p>
  <p>And she could dream under the real</p>
  <p>Thing as she wondered who to be</p>
  <p>Or fly towards the dark and just be</p>
