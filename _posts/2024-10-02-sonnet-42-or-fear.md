<div class="notice">
  <p>"Tell dem seh a fine bone yuh have"</p>
  <p>I was bald for years</p>
  <p>Now look at my thick black mane</p>
  <p>His ears, his tail, his eyes lit up</p>
  <p>And I loved him like I loved myself</p>
  <p>When I didn't love me, I left</p>
  <p>Him but his eyes remembered me</p>
  <p>I was happy then sad again</p>
  <p>I've lit candles and soaked pillows</p>
  <p>What's this aching thing?</p>
  <p>Who's this nobody to check in?</p>
  <p>It's spinning and we're falling off</p>
  <p>One by one before the final end</p>
  <p>I'm crying, I'm dying and when - </p>
