<div class="notice">
  <p>The details are blurry in my mind</p>
  <p>Maybe 15 years ago as wife</p>
  <p>I was role in and homemade</p>
  <p>And disappointed.</p>
  <p>I'd smile and introduce me as wife</p>
  <p>Suppressing these feelings for nuclear</p>
  <p>Even prior, I'd use her as hope</p>
  <p>To keep us aflame while I bare</p>
  <p>Myself to holes and beaches you liked</p>
  <p>Banging once or twice or however many times</p>
  <p>To her eyes and my head and future life</p>
  <p>Now the seizures, scares, moments of craze</p>
  <p>Dance around my finger, the prize</p>
  <p>But tug at her sad, remembering eyes </p>
